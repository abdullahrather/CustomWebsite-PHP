            <p>More than <a href="uploads/InternalResults_180205_Feminism_Suffragettes_w.pdf">two-thirds of Britons</a> consider the National Health Service to be Britain&rsquo;s greatest achievement. We are fortunate to have access to healthcare, for virtually any ailment, free at the point of care for every UK citizen. So, with virtually all the treatments you could ever need freely available on the NHS, why would you want private healthcare for you or your family?</p>

<h2>Private Health Insurance is more Than a Back-Up Plan</h2>

<p>There is no question that the NHS does incredible work and that we are all grateful to have it, but as headlines continue to reinforce, the NHS has limited funds and resources. The growing population and increasing demand on the NHS services, along with reduced Government investment means the service is often operating beyond its capacity and the strain can begin to show.</p>

<p>These strains can often amount to lengthy waiting times, procedures that are repeatedly cancelled due to lack of beds, and difficulty accessing state-of-the-art procedures or drugs due to funding limitations.</p>

<p>Very often, private medical procedures or consultations will take place with the very same healthcare professionals who would also treat you on the NHS. Many doctors have both private and NHS practices - the difference with using private healthcare is that you will have a choice.</p>

<p>With many procedures, time is of the essence, so having access to timely treatment can mean you are back on your feet and getting back to normal life far more quickly than if you have to wait for NHS treatment.</p>

<p>Many people waiting for elective surgery on the NHS will receive a date for surgery, make arrangements with their employers or those providing childcare and support during the recovery period only for that date to be cancelled at the last minute. This means the entire process must begin again.</p>

<p>Most patients are very understanding of the NHS&rsquo; limitations and understand these decisions are not taken lightly, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the frustrations do not impact on their lives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Peace of mind</h2>

<p>By opting for private medical care, you can have the peace of mind that should you or your family need treatment or surgery for one of the hundreds of approved conditions, you will be able to access the skills of a top surgeon quickly. Not only will you be seen quickly, but the chances of your treatment being delayed or cancelled due to other patient commitments or unforeseen circumstances within the hospital are far lower.</p>

<p>Far from undermining the NHS, if those who have the means to do so take advantage of private healthcare, this can ease the strain on the public healthcare system. A reduction in elective surgery taking place in NHS hospitals will free up beds and improve everyone&rsquo;s access to emergency medicine should the need ever arise.</p>

<p><em>Doctor-led private health insurance from <a href="index.php">County Medical</a> can provide you and your family with the safety net of being able to access private healthcare whenever you need it, without having to worry about the cost. We can still be proud of the NHS, whilst doing our bit to relieve the strain on the service and safeguard our family&rsquo;s health and wellbeing as well.</em></p>
