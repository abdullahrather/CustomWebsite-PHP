<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">County Medical health insurance policies fill a gap between a struggling NHS and a private medical insurance market aimed mainly at the corporate sector.<br />
<br />
County Medical prioritises individuals and small businesses, people who care about the health of their families but who demand value for money and a high quality of service. As a doctor run organisation, it is at the point of use that you will appreciate our strength in terms of support, flexibility and clarity.</span></span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Our aim is to be there for you at your time of need.</span><br />

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">County Medical was formed by a group of senior doctors to whom the challenges being faced by the NHS have been apparent for some time. &nbsp;</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;"> Waiting times and cancellations will continue to rise as the NHS struggles financially. However, few patients can afford delays </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">to</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;"> their treatment. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">In future, private medical treatment will become more common and people will need private health insurance.&nbsp; This has, until now, been generally regarded as something for very wealthy individuals and large corporate organisations as the policies can often be prohibitively expensive. </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">We don&rsquo;t think this needs to be the case and have designed a product which is competitively priced, provides </span><span style="font-size:16px;">high-quality</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> support and sits comfortably alongside the NHS.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">As a doctor run organisation, we know the importance of good medical care and how to deliver it.</span></span></p>

<h4>We&rsquo;re transparent</h4>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Our list of procedures is readily available so you know what you are covered for. This list covers an overwhelming range of procedures that are carried out routinely under private medical insurance schemes. Procedures that you are unlikely to have done privately, or are better off being treated for on the NHS, are excluded so that you can save on your premium.</span></p>

<h4>We treat our members as people, not as claims</h4>

<p>For the NHS, County Medical means invaluable support; the work our medical network undertakes is carried out in addition to and not instead of traditional NHS treatments and procedures and the income generated from this specialist, private treatment makes a considerable contribution to the running costs of the regional NHS trusts.</p>
